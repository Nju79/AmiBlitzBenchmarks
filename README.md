# AmiBlitzBenchmarks

You are planning to write a game for the Amiga and want to use AmiBlitz? That's great! You will find that there are several ways to implement something. Some are suitable, others are not. This is especially important on the Amiga, where every frame counts.
This collection of benchmark scripts should help you to recognize certain brakes and to optimize your games or to avoid certain mistakes already during the prototype creation.

Please note that the time for creating and handling the loops must be deducted from the graphics benchmarks!
